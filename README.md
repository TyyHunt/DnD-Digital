# D&D Digital - React and Rails API Application

## Project Overview

As a previous player of Dungeons and Dragons I always found that at the end of a campaign my character sheet would be see-through in places where my character changed the most.  It occured to me that with a "there's an app for that" mentality you could easily structure an application to handle a character sheet, save that sheet, and update it whenever your group plays.

I was thinking about making this website during my first CLI project from Flatiron School and my understanding of multiple frameworks allowed this to be a possibility. This website includes...

 - Rails Backend
 - React Frontend
 - Redux
 - Redux thunk
 - React Router

## Getting Start
 - Download or clone this repository
 - run 'npm install'
 - open your favorite text editor and open the folder
 - run 'rake db:seed' to add the application information
 - run 'rake start' (this will start the rails framework on localhost:3001 an the react framework on localhost:3000)
